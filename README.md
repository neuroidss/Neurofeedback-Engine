# Neurofeedback Engine

**Live Demo:** [https://neuroidss.github.io/Neurofeedback-Engine/](https://neuroidss.github.io/Neurofeedback-Engine/)

The Neurofeedback Engine is a browser-first platform for an **AI agent capable of autonomous neuroscience research and development**. It mines the latest scientific papers for novel EEG-based brain training protocols and instantly generates **new, executable neurofeedback tools** for interfaces like the FreeEEG8.

The core of the platform is a "fast food" model for neuro-technology: a powerful, automated engine that transforms scientific knowledge into ready-to-use digital tools, bridging the gap between the lab and the user. The visual feedback mechanism itself is not pre-defined; it is generated by the AI as a unique software tool for each protocol.

## The Generation Engine: From Paper to Protocol in Minutes

Instead of slow, manual R&D, the Neurofeedback Engine automates the discovery-to-deployment pipeline.

1.  **Objective-Driven Research:** The user provides a high-level research domain, such as "deep relaxation" or "enhancing gamma-wave activity for focus."

2.  **Autonomous Literature Review:** An AI agent deconstructs the objective, searches scientific databases like PubMed, and identifies the most relevant and reliable research paper.

3.  **AI-Powered Code Generation:** Based on the paper, the agent **writes the code for a new React component** that implements the described neurofeedback logic. This visualizer *is* the neurofeedback protocol.

4.  **Instant Tool Creation & Deployment:** The newly generated code is immediately registered in the system as a **new, executable LLM Tool**. It instantly appears in the "Protocol Library," ready to be run in the app's "Neurofeedback Player" with a single click.

### Use Case: Generating a Focus Trainer

1.  **Objective:** The user enters the research domain: *"Enhance focus."*
2.  **Research:** The AI searches for "neurofeedback focus EEG gamma" and finds a paper linking sustained attention to an increased `gamma / theta` ratio.
3.  **Code & Tool Generation:** The agent instructs the AI to create a visualizer that rewards a high `gamma / theta` ratio. The AI writes a React component that displays a circle that grows and glows brighter as this ratio increases. This code is then packaged and registered as a new tool named "Gamma/Theta Focus Trainer".
4.  **Deployment:** The new tool, "Gamma/Theta Focus Trainer," appears in the Protocol Library. The user can run it immediately and see the circle react to a simulated EEG stream, which is processed in real-time according to the logic described in the original paper.

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous R&D Agent:** An AI pipeline that searches for, validates, and synthesizes neuroscience research.
*   **On-the-Fly Tool Generation:** The visual feedback component itself is dynamically created as a new, executable React-based tool based on scientific findings.
*   **Dynamic Protocol Library:** All generated tools are immediately available in a simple library for the user to select and run.
*   **Neurofeedback Player as a Host:** A dedicated UI panel that dynamically loads and runs any selected neurofeedback protocol tool.
*   **Science-Driven Data Processing:** Raw EEG signals are processed in real-time using Python code generated by an AI based *directly* on the methods described in the source scientific paper.
*   **Client-First / Serverless:** The entire AI research and UI runs in the browser without any required backend. Simply open `index.html` to get started.

## Getting Started

Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome or Edge). No installation or server is required to run the core application.
