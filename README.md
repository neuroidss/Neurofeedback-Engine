# Neurofeedback Engine

**Live Demo:** [https://neuroidss.github.io/Neurofeedback-Engine/](https://neuroidss.github.io/Neurofeedback-Engine/)

The Neurofeedback Engine is a browser-first platform for an **AI agent capable of autonomous neuroscience research and development**. It mines the latest scientific papers for novel EEG-based brain training protocols and instantly generates **new, executable neurofeedback tools** for interfaces like the FreeEEG8.

The core of the platform is a "fast food" model for neuro-technology: a powerful, automated engine that transforms scientific knowledge into ready-to-use digital tools, bridging the gap between the lab and the user. The visual feedback mechanism itself is not pre-defined; it is generated by the AI as a unique software tool for each protocol.

## The Generation Engine: From Paper to Protocol in Minutes

Instead of slow, manual R&D, the Neurofeedback Engine automates the discovery-to-deployment pipeline.

1.  **Objective-Driven Research:** The user provides a high-level research domain, such as "deep relaxation" or "enhancing gamma-wave activity for focus."

2.  **Autonomous Literature Review:** An AI agent deconstructs the objective, searches scientific databases like PubMed, and identifies the most relevant and reliable research paper.

3.  **AI-Powered Code Generation:** Based on the paper, the agent generates two key artifacts:
    *   **Processing Code:** A JavaScript function that processes raw EEG data into the specific metrics described in the paper (e.g., calculating the `gamma / theta` ratio).
    *   **UI Code:** A React component that implements the visual feedback logic based on the processed metrics.

4.  **Instant Tool Creation & Deployment:** The newly generated code is immediately registered in the system as a **new, executable LLM Tool**. It instantly appears in the "Protocol Library," ready to be run in the app's "Neurofeedback Player" with a single click.

### Use Case: Generating a Focus Trainer

1.  **Objective:** The user enters the research domain: *"Enhance focus."*
2.  **Research:** The AI searches for "neurofeedback focus EEG gamma" and finds a paper linking sustained attention to an increased `gamma / theta` ratio.
3.  **Code & Tool Generation:** The agent instructs the AI to create the necessary components.
    *   It generates a **processing function** that takes raw EEG data and outputs a `{ "gamma_theta_ratio": 0.85 }` object.
    *   It generates a **React UI component** that receives this ratio and displays a circle that grows and glows brighter as the value increases.
    *   These artifacts are packaged and registered as a new tool named "Gamma/Theta Focus Trainer".
4.  **Deployment:** The new tool, "Gamma/Theta Focus Trainer," appears in the Protocol Library. When run, the Player's built-in **EEG Simulator** provides the necessary raw data, which is fed into the tool's processing function. The resulting ratio is then passed to the UI component, and the user sees the circle react in real-time.

## Key Features

*   **Autonomous R&D Agent:** An AI pipeline that searches for, validates, and synthesizes neuroscience research.
*   **On-the-Fly Tool Generation:** Each protocol is dynamically created as a new, executable tool with two parts: a data processing function and a visual UI component.
*   **Dynamic Protocol Library:** All generated tools are immediately available in a simple library for the user to select and run.
*   **Neurofeedback Player as a Host:** A dedicated UI panel that dynamically loads and runs any selected neurofeedback protocol tool.
*   **Science-Driven Data Processing:** Raw EEG signals are processed in real-time using Python code generated by an AI based *directly* on the methods described in the source scientific paper.
*   **Intelligent Data Simulation:** For users without a hardware device, a built-in simulator generates the specific raw EEG data required by each protocol, enabling immediate use and testing.
*   **Hardware-Ready Architecture:** The separation of data source, processing, and UI allows for future integration of real EEG devices to replace the simulator.
*   **Client-First / Serverless:** The entire AI research and UI runs in the browser without any required backend. Simply open `index.html` to get started.

## Getting Started

Simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome or Edge). No installation or server is required to run the core application.
